Sprite: in computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game.

Wraparound: in video games, is a gameplay variation on the single-screen in which space is finite but unbounded; objects leaving one side of the screen immediately reappear on the opposite side, maintaining speed and trajectory.
